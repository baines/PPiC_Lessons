# Explanation

These are small lessons / challenges / puzzles to help improve familiarity with
the C programming language.

You have to fill in empty functions in template .c files and, when compiled and
ran, these functions will be automatically tested to verify their correctness.

The puzzles are intended to be at an intermediate level; they assume some basic
understanding of the C language already.

This repo was created to help Miblo with his
[Practising Programming in C stream series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnhxk264xvpV-VS3rlhje8zgP01TjAECr)
, but anyone is welcome to use these materials for their own learning.
